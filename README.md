The repository is constantly updated when **Python** or **SQL** solution to the problem found at [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/) or [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/python) is solved. The solutions to **LeetCode** problems are posted at the discussion sections in each solved problem folder. If the solved **Leetcode** problem is one of the problems asked by MAANG companies then that solution of specific company is added as my GitHub solution found through [contents](#table-of-contents).

The progress of my **LeetCode** account regarding these solutions with additional information on them can be found by looking at my [LeetCode profile](https://leetcode.com/aurimas13/).

The **Leetcode** solutions of **Python** are found  [here](https://github.com/aurimas13/HackerRank-LeetCode/tree/main/LeetCode/Python%20Solutions) while **HackerRank** solutions of **Python** are found [here](https://github.com/aurimas13/HackerRank-LeetCode/tree/main/HackerRank/Python%20Solutions). Each problem folder has the description of the problem found through pressing the link in **README** at the respective folder or if it is provided for the particular MAANG company found through [contents](#table-of-contents). By pressing on that company you will be redirected to the problem description (1st column) followed by the solution in GitHub (2nd column).

Currently, doing **Python** problems of **LeetCode**. **HackerRank** problems were finished May and from *28th of May 2022* am working on solving at least one **Python** problem from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/) daily. The solution is put at the respective **LeetCode** folder and updated through [MAANG contents list](#table-of-contents). 

**SQL** solutions of problems at *HackerRank* & *LeetCode* will come in Fall while they will be updated [here](https://github.com/aurimas13/HackerRank-LeetCode/tree/main/HackerRank/SQL%20Solutions) for **HackerRank** and [here](https://github.com/aurimas13/HackerRank-LeetCode/tree/main/LeetCode/SQL%20Solutions) for **LeetCode**.

## Preparation for Interviews

To prepare for a MAANG interview or a MAANG-level company interview as well as land a job there I highly recommend solving as many problems below as possible and doing one or all of these:
- Joining [Hackpack](https://www.hackpack.io/) community
- Solving [Top LeetCode Problems](https://github.com/aurimas13/LeetCode-and-FAANG/blob/main/Public/TopLeetCodeProblems.md)
- Honing [Python Skills](https://github.com/aurimas13/LeetCode-and-FAANG/blob/main/Public/PythonResources.md)
- Looking at possible [Multiple Choice Questions](https://github.com/aurimas13/LeetCode-HackerRank-MAANG/blob/main/Public/MCQ.txt)
